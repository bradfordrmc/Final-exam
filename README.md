# Final-exam
for this exam decided to complete quetions 1 and 3. I did this Due to having diffculties install the necessary files fgor open cv to work. Also i live alone so having to seperate faces to scan for part two wouldve been a hassle. For the part ! I used program that involves the speech recognition and espak libraries to make systme that works similar to a google home. For mine however instead of "Okay Google" it is "okay Raspberry".
  For the PArt 3 I did not have the acces to my final applied research project and wasnt really prepared to present it by myself without having the physical project with me. Instead I showcased a side project that i did for my home. It is RGB lamp that makes use of the rgb leds found the various kits and all uses the IR remote and sensor to pick different colors. I completed the project using recycled materials which is something i'm quite passionate about. I enjoy repurposing Junk.
